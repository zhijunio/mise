# EVERY mise command that reads the global config dies with:
#     mise ERROR [experimental] Failed to decrypt A
#     mise ERROR [experimental] No age identities found for decryption
# including `mise bootstrap --only packages`. You cannot use the real config to
# install the tool that fetches the key that decrypts the real config.
#
# Escape hatch: MISE_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE pointed at an EMPTY toml. mise then runs
# with no global config, so there is nothing to decrypt, and bitwarden can be
# pulled in ad hoc via `mise x`.
